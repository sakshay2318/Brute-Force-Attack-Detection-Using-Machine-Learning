# Brute-Force-Attack-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

This repository contains a deep learning model designed to detect brute force attacks. The project aims to leverage the power of deep learning to analyze network traffic patterns and identify potential brute force attacks in real-time.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system capable of identifying brute force attacks on network systems. By utilizing deep learning techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and speed of attack detection, thereby improving overall network security.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakshay2318/Brute-Force-Attack-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Brute-Force-Attack-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
```
3. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can run the main script to start detecting brute force attacks. Use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

This script will initiate the deep learning model and begin monitoring network traffic for signs of brute force attacks.
